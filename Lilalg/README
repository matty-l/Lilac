# This is the main directory for the Lilac Linear Algebra package which deals
# entirely and only with 4x4 matrices for use in transformation pipelines. It
# has its own setup file so that it can be used independently from the Lilac
# graphics engine, and comes with its own front-end, including logical indexing
# for matrices
